This repository contains a few snippets of code written in DogeScript.
Because why not.

* [dogeCoinChange(amount, coins)](https://github.com/Ajax4778/DogeScript/blob/master/doge_coin_change.djs): makes change for a total amount from an array of coin denominations
* [binarySearch(arr, target)](https://github.com/Ajax4778/DogeScript/blob/master/binary_search.djs): searches a sorted array for a target element
* [clockAngle(time)](https://github.com/Ajax4778/DogeScript/blob/master/clock_angle.djs): calculates the angle between the hands of a clock at a given time

(DogeScript compiles to plain old JavaScript. For more information, see the [DogeScript website](https://dogescript.com/).)
